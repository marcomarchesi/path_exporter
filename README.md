# path_exporter
Simple addon for exporting curves from Blender (2.73) to Threejs. Useful for cameras following paths.
Example of output:

`var sampleClosedSpline = new THREE.ClosedSplineCurve3( [ <br>
  new THREE.Vector3(-0.33,0.33,2.14),<br>
  new THREE.Vector3(-0.58,0.68,-2.94),<br>
  new THREE.Vector3(-4.7,0.53,-5.09),<br>
  new THREE.Vector3(-8.29,0.09,-3.79),<br>
  new THREE.Vector3(-9.33,0.69,-2.15),<br>
  new THREE.Vector3(-8.0,0.63,1.31),<br>
  new THREE.Vector3(-7.21,0.41,4.3),<br>
  new THREE.Vector3(-0.01,0.13,7.23),<br>
  new THREE.Vector3(-0.1,0.44,4.61)<br>
] );`
